// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//     • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
//
// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
